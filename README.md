# Student-Data-Analysis
This project is about analysing student’s data and knowing particular trends about it and using this information for better student’s performance in their academics.  First, we collected student’s information and formed datasets. This includes various factors such as parent’s education level, student’s desire to receive higher education, their family background, attendance, marks of unit tests, their study time, etc. To know which factors exactly affect student’s performance, we analysed few features using various libraries in python.
